# PokemonPark
This is a course project in UCSD using OpenGL to render a Pokemon world and Pokemons. My group member and I used several techniques including toon shading, physical collision detection using bounding spheres, procedurally generated terrain and plants and so on. 

We implement Diamond Algorithm to produce a terrain in the world and give it different color according to the depth of the point: points with high z value would be white, medium z value would be green, and low z value would be rock color.
